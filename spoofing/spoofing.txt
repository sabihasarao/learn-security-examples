Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.


Spoofing is a cybersecurity vulnerability where attackers imitate trusted entities to deraud users and gain unauthorized access.
 Secure versions fight this by using authentication and encryption protocols, 
 such as two-factor authentication. These measures ensure the integrity 
 and authenticity of data providing confidentiality.
